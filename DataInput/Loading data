To reading data into the system in the correct format and checking for erroneous or missing entries is often one of the most time consuming parts of the data analysis.

Data input can be complicated by a number of problems, like different separators between data entries (such as spaces and/or tabulators), or empty lines at the end of the file. 
In addition, data may have been saved in different formats, such as MS Excel, Matlab, HDF5 (which also includes the Matlab-format), or in databases. Understandably,
we cannot cover all possible input options. 


Input from Text Files 

A typical workflow can contain the following steps:
• Changing to the folder where the data are stored.
• Listing the items in that folder.
• Selecting one of these items, and reading in the corresponding data.
• Checking if the data have been read in completely, and in the correct format.
